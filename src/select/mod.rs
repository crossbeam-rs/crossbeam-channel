/// The dynamic selection interface.
///
/// It allows declaring an arbitrary (possibly dynamic) list of operations on channels, and waiting
/// until exactly one of them fires. The interface is somewhat tricky to use and care must be taken
/// in order to use it correctly.
///
/// If possible, it is highly recommended to use the [`select_loop!`] macro instead, which is much
/// easier to use. The downside of the macro is that it only allows selecting over a statically
/// defined set of operations.
///
/// # What is selection?
///
/// It is possible to declare a set of possible send and/or receive operations on channels, and
/// then wait until exactly one of them fires (in other words, one of them is *selected*).
///
/// For example, we might want to receive a message from a set of two channels and block until a
/// message is received from any of them. To do that, we would write:
///
/// ```
/// use std::thread;
/// use crossbeam_channel::{unbounded, Select};
///
/// let (tx1, rx1) = unbounded();
/// let (tx2, rx2) = unbounded();
///
/// thread::spawn(move || tx1.send("foo").unwrap());
/// thread::spawn(move || tx2.send("bar").unwrap());
///
/// let mut sel = Select::new();
/// loop {
///     if let Ok(msg) = sel.recv(&rx1) {
///         println!("A message was received from rx1: {:?}", msg);
///         break;
///     }
///     if let Ok(msg) = sel.recv(&rx2) {
///         println!("A message was received from rx2: {:?}", msg);
///         break;
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// There are two selection *cases*: a receive on `rx1` and a receive on `rx2`. The loop is
/// continuously probing both channels until one of the cases successfully receives a message. Then
/// we print the message and the loop is broken.
///
/// Note that `sel` holds an internal state machine that keeps track of how many cases there are,
/// which channels are closed, etc. It is smart enough to automatically register each case into an
/// internal conditional variable of sorts, block on it, and wake up when any of the cases become
/// ready.
///
/// You don't need to wory about blocking or about the loop burning CPU time - the selection
/// mechanism will automatically block and wake up the current thread as is necessary. However,
/// there are a few rules that must be followed when probing cases in a loop.
///
/// # Selection cases
///
/// There are five kinds of selection cases:
///
/// 1. A *receive* case, which fires when a message can be received from the channel.
/// 2. A *send* case, which fires when the message can be sent into the channel.
/// 3. A *would block* case, which fires when all receive and send operations in the loop would
///    block.
/// 4. A *closed* case, which fires when all operations in the loop are working with closed
///    channels.
/// 5. A *timed out* case, which fires when selection is blocked for longer than the specified
///    timeout.
///
/// # Selection rules
///
/// Rules which must be respected in order for selection to work properly:
///
/// 1. Before each selection, a fresh [`Select`] must be created.
/// 2. Selection cases must be repeatedly probed in a loop.
/// 3. If a selection case fires, the loop must be broken without probing cases any further.
/// 4. In each iteration of the loop, the same set of cases must be probed in the same order.
/// 5. No selection case may be repeated.
/// 6. No two cases may operate on the same end (receiving or sending) of the same channel.
/// 7. There must be at least one *send*, or at least one *recv* case.
///
/// Violating any of these rules will either result in a panic, deadlock, or livelock, possibly
/// even in a seemingly unrelated send or receive operations outside this particular selection
/// loop.
///
/// # Guarantees
///
/// 1. Exactly one case fires.
/// 2. If none of the cases can fire at the time, one of the calls in the loop will block the
///    current thread.
/// 3. If blocked, the current thread will be woken up as soon a message is pushed/popped into/from
///    any channel waited on by a receive/send case, or if all channels get closed.
///
/// Finally, if more than one send or receive case can fire at the same time, a pseudorandom case
/// will be selected, but on a best-effort basis only. The mechanism isn't promising any strict
/// guarantees on fairness.
///

///

///
/// ```
/// use std::thread;
/// use crossbeam_channel::{unbounded, Select};
